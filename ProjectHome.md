This jQuery plugin will transition between images with a nice fade In/Out. It only requires a couple of lines of CSS and a regular jQuery Plugin call. You have full control on the number of images, the delay and a lot more. It can play backwards once it reaches the end, or it will start all over again from image 1.

You do not need to have all the images inside your HTML!

The plugin reads the path of the 1st image and then loads the next numbered image under the same path. Your images will need to be named numerically in sequence, as in: 1.jpg, 2.jpg, etc...

Lastly, the extension will need to be the same as the 1st image.

The project is actively maintained by Navig8 Ltd, London.
